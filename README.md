Rockchain, the decentralized rule engine that puts data privacy at its core, released its white paper. Check it on www.rockchain.org

Abstract:
Rockchain is a distributed rule engine based on Ethereum, Raiden, Docker and Kubernetes, focused on data privacy, auditability of rules results transfers, auditability of the rules logic.

We believe in the future emergence of cloud networks with both trusted components and untrusted components working together. We believe the management of such networks will use cloud orchestration tools such as Kubernetes, a blockchain for auditability and microtransactions, and a distributed rule engine such as Rockchain to allow algorithms to work on a network of both trusted and untrusted nodes. A distributed rule engine has the potential to become a trust-backbone for cloud microservices to collaborate economically.
