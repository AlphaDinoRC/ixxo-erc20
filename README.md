Rockchain, the Ethereum data privacy protocols is described on www.rockchain.org

Abstract:
Rockchain is a second infrastructure layer on top of Ethereum for managing data privacy. Its dAppBox is a data firewall whose rules are defined in Ethereum smart contract. This dappBox is open to computations that don't breach the data privacy.

Our crowdsale contract is defined in contracts/Crowdsale.sol

The underlying token is defined in contracts/ROKToken.sol

The repository includes scripts (based on Truffle) for testing the contract deployment folder.
It also contains detailed unit tests in the folder test.
